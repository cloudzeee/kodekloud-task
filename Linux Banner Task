Question
============

During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login. Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /tmp/nautilus_banner on jump host

Solution
===========

*The Linux command 'SCP' is used when copying files between two remote servers/locations. So run the following on thor@jump_host server. You would also be required to put in password

scp -r nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:/home/tony
scp -r nautilus_banner steve@stappp02:/home/steve
scp -r nautilus_banner banner@stapp03:/home/banner

*For DB server you may face issues and have to install openssh-clients. To do this:

Login to the DBserver using SSH
Login as super user. Using sudo su -
Run yum install -y openssh-clients
Log out of the DBserver using Ctrl+D
Run the command for step 1 again: scp /home/thor/nautulus_banner peter@stdb01:/tmp

Then ssh to all servers and run sudo mv nautilus_banner /etc/motd to enable it display as soon as a user logs in.
