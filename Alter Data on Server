Question
=========
There is some data on Nautilus App Server 3 in Stratos DC. Data needs to be altered in several of the files. On Nautilus App Server 3, alter the /home/BSD.txt file as per details given below:
a. Delete all lines containing word code and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file. (Please be aware of case sensitivity)

b. Replace all occurrence of word or to them and save results in /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt file.

Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter any words containing this string; for example upto, contributor etc.


Solution
==========
First check location and make sure you have text located in BSD.txt
- ssh banner@stapp03  //ssh to server 3
- cd .. //come back to home directory
- cat BSD.txt  // to view the content of BSD.txt file


*the syntax to find and delete a word , then sve to a different is  sed -e 's/\<regex-for-word\>//g' input > output . sed is a stream editor. It can perform basic text manipulation on files and input streams such as pipelines. With sed, you can search, find and replace, insert, and delete words and lines. 

CD into home directory and run the following

sed -e '/code/d' BSD.txt > BSD_DELETE.txt    //to delete the word code and save file in DSD_DELETE.txt

You can check and confirm word is delete
cat BSD.txt | grep code  //if now entry is returned then code worked

sed 's/or/them/g' BSD.txt > BSD_REPLACE.txt   //Replaces the word or with them
